# CSE216 HW 2 Sadashiva Yalla

Overall in this hw the main things I learned were:
  - Javascript Syntax and how OOP principles work in JavaScript compared to C++
  - The localeCompare function which made it very easy to get the string which is greater than or less than.
  - review of C++ pointers 
  - Binary Search Tree in JavaScript 
  - Hashtable Data Structure in JavaScript
